# Machine Learning Notebooks – Study & Reference

This repository contains a structured collection of Jupyter notebooks covering
the main Machine Learning algorithms and workflows.

The notebooks are based on the **Machine Learning A–Z (Udemy)** course and were
executed, reviewed, and adapted by me as part of my training in data analysis
and applied machine learning.

## Purpose of this repository

- Serve as a **technical reference** for classical ML algorithms
- Practice the **full ML workflow**: preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
- Compare supervised and unsupervised approaches
- Reinforce understanding of strengths, limitations, and assumptions of each model

## Covered topics

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Regression models
- Classification algorithms
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Association Rule Learning
- Reinforcement Learning (introductory)
- Natural Language Processing (basic)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA)
- Model selection and evaluation
- Introductory Deep Learning

## Important note

This repository is **not intended as a set of original end-to-end projects**.
For applied data analysis projects with problem definition, EDA, metrics and
conclusions, please refer to:

- 👉 `DBSCAN_Mocks`
- 👉 `ChurnInsight` (collaborative, private – available upon request)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
